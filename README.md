# TavernlightTrial
 
See Q1-Q4.lua for answers to trial questions one through four. Navigate to Videos for the recording of question 5 and forgottenserver->data->spells->scripts->attack->eternal_winter.lua for the implementation. Unfortunately, I spent most of my time setting up the TFS, OTC, phpMyAdmin, UniServer Zero X111, and Znote AAC, however, this was my first time working with any of them. Now that I know how to set it up, all I want to do is face-palm. I got to the stage of question 7 where I was learning more about modules and how to incorporate them into a system.
